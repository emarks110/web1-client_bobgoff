						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p>Laying out the design challenge was the first step to truly getting to know my client Bob Goff. I accessed the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit to help guide me throught the design challenge process.
</p>
					</header>
					<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
						<p>Organzing and helping users understand who Bob Goff is and his non-profit.</p>
						<h3>The Design Question:</h3>
						<p>How can the website be more organized and display his different books, organization, and programs in a well thought out way that benefits the user?
</p>
						<h3>The Ultimate Impact</h3>
						<p>To impact others by showing them their gorls and how to love and be loved greater.</p>
						<h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>Hierachy</li>
							 	<li>High-Quality images (othr than his face)</li>
						 		<li>Organization</li>
						   	<li>Simpler to Nagivate through (less complex)</li>
						 	 	<li>Display the different ways he is helping his community</li>
						 	 	<li>Make all different websites into one concise websites</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<h3>Context and Constraints</h3>
						<p>Range of different countries and people in need from needing food or help making their dream come true. Wide range of people needing help and/or guidance which is hard to follow and keep up with all the different aspects.</p>
						<h3>The Design Question Restated</h3>
						<p><strong>"How can the re-design of this website attract users to Bob Goff's organization and books?"</strong></p>
